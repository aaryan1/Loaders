# Loaders

==========================

This project aims at creating an animation library for different types of loading animations, progress dialogs, etc.

The current structure is:

Project: Loaders
    |   settings.gradle
    +   app/
        |   build.gradle
        |   java
        |   res
    +   lib/
        |   build.gradle
        |   java
        |   res

So, if you want to contribute, please add new class in Loaders/lib/java/.

NOTE: Especially @pa1pal, for you, add new AsyncTask inherited classes in the above mentioned folder. I've setup everything. Just start writing code for animation and create a dummy application in the Loaders/app/java. Ok, here you go. :burger:
