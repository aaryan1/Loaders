==========================

This project aims at creating an animation library for different types of loading animations, progress dialogs, etc.

The current structure is:

Project: Loaders  
>        |   settings.gradle  
>        +   app/  
>            |   build.gradle  
>            |   java  
>            |   res  
>        +   lib/  
>            |   build.gradle  
>            |   java  
>            |   res  

So, if you want to contribute, please add new class in Loaders/lib/java/.

NOTE: Especially @pa1pal, for you, add new AsyncTask inherited classes in the above mentioned folder. I've setup everything. Just start writing code for animation and create a dummy application in the Loaders/app/java. Ok, here you go.
